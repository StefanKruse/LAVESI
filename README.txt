This source code can be compiled to build the Larix vegetation simulator LAVESI. This program simulates the vegetation dynamics of the larch tree species LARIX GMELINII (RUPR.) RUPR. which are driven by monthly weater data series.

The version of this code is 1.01. and the building process and application is described in the following publication in Ecological Modeling: 
Stefan Kruse, Mareike Wieczorek, Florian Jeltsch and Ulrike Herzschuh (2016) Treeline dynamics in Siberia under changing climates as inferred from an individual-based model for Larix. Ecological Modelling, 338, 101–121. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.08.003
